"aboutContent" : "<p>Groundbreaking visual effects artist <a href=\"http://www.rayharryhausen.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ray Harryhausen Official Site (opens in a new window)\">Ray Harryhausen</a> refined and elevated stop-motion animation to an art. His <strong>Dynamation</strong> technique of matting animated creatures into live-action settings revolutionized the use of stop-motion visual effects in feature films.</p><p>Ray Harryhausen's creations aren't the most realistic in the realm of special effects, but Ray's touch is instantly recognizable. His creations are absolutely alive; in each frame his creatures move, twitch, breathe, <strong>act</strong> with personality and pathos. Few other low-budget monster movies of the time match the technical competence and respect for the subject as Mr. Harryhausen's films.</p><p>The Ray Harryhausen Creature list emphasizes Ray's work in feature films. Not included are his early <a href=\"http://www.archive.org/details/mother_goose_little_miss_muffet\" rel=\"tag\" target=\"_blank\">Mother Goose shorts</a>; test reels and unrealized projects; some stop-motion effects shots (like the discus toss in <em>Jason and the Argonauts</em>); live-action effects (like the Iguana stand-in dinosaur from <em>One Million Years B.C.</em>); miniatures (including the <em>Mysterious Island</em> balloon); makeup &amp; prosthetics, and animated replacements for humans caught in creatures' clutches. Ray Harryhausen deserves further credit for his groundbreaking work in composite effects, demonstrated to great effect in <em>The 3 Worlds of Gulliver</em>.</p>"
